My personal experiments repository

I have been experimenting with HTML, CSS mostly and Javascript partially for two-three years.
Now, after some designing, I'm participating the #100DaysofCode challenge, and I'm learning
basic Javascript stuff, deepening my knowledge of some method and properties.
